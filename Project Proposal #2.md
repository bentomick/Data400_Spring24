#### Research Question

How does a state’s economic development affect their NFL attendance and performance?  

#### Reason

The NFL is the largest league in America and generates the most income, so I think it would be interesting to see how a state’s economic prosperity could benefit their fan attendance and performance. I want to see how economic development impact disposable income and in turn fan engagement and attendance. It will then be important to see how attendance affects the actual outcome and performance of the team. Finally, it would be interesting to see how the financial status within a state impacts a team through investment in infrastructure, health resources, and other benefits that lead to improved performance. 

#### Data Sources

Data on football attendance and performance will come from Pro Football Reference, and state economic data will come from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Bureau of Labor Statistics. 


#### Analysis
I plan on running different regression models to see the relationship between state economic variables and NFL attendance and performance. It will first be important to run a regression model to see how attendance impacts performance, and then we can run analysis on how economic status affects attendance.
