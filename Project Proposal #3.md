#### Research Question

How do a country’s primary food sources affect their health and economic output?  

#### Reason

It is important to understand the interconnectedness of agriculture, nutrition, and economic development, as it can help a country better prioritize their health and in turn improve economic development. Understanding the predominant food sources in a country provides insights into dietary patterns and nutritional intake, which directly influence public health outcomes. Insights gained from analyzing this relationship can inform policymakers about the potential benefits of diversifying food production systems, promoting dietary diversity, and investing in agricultural research and development to enhance both health and economic outcomes.

#### Data Sources

Data on food sources and quantities comes from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Data on country population, obesity, and undernourished come from the Population Reference Bureau. Finally, data on economic development in each country comes from the World Bank of Data. . 


#### Analysis
I plan on running different regression models to see the relationship between economic development and food sources. I also want to analyze the relationship between the percentage of calories, protein, and fats from certain foods on a country’s obesity and undernourishment.
